# AMS2-TrackReducer
AMS2 is a great game with a lot of historical tracks and multiple discipline of motorsports (Karting, Rallycross, etc) but with the file size being above 120gb and Storage devices becoming mroe expensive. It's hard to justify keeping the game or introducing the game to others. So im gonna share my files to reduce historical, dirt, and rx tracks
